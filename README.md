# Abstract

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world.
Outbreaks in different parts of the globe are shaped by repeated introductions of new lineages
and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2
viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
Washington State (USA) was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across
counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we
show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over
time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of
614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of
higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records
data, we do not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient
outcomes. Overall, this suggests that with regards to D614G, the behavior of individuals has
been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic than changes in the virus.
